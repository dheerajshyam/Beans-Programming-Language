Beans is a new programming language which is being created with an initiative to make programming more fun, easier, efficient, available in various forms to develop in a multi-purpose way, etc. Generally programming languages are created for a certain purpose and later they are extended to be used as a general purpose programming language. Popular examples for this are:

**Perl** (Main use: string manipiulation, Used as: General purpose programming language)<br>
**Java** (Main use: consumer electronic devices to communicate with each other, Used as: General purpose programming language)<br>
**Python** (Main use: bridge the gap between C and the shell, Used as: General purpose programming language), **etc**.
